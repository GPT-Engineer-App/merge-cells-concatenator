# merge-cells-concatenator


lets assume we have two documents, each has a certain table with some rows and their cells.

My goal is two navigate to a certain cell in the second document, and to clone its whole content
and to append the cloned content to the end of a certain cell in the first document.

A "merge" or "concatenation" to keep it in other words.

The cloned content may comprise any kind of child-node, as well as fields, anything!
(in other words: any "content-composition")

The PSEUDO-Code for the Java-Method i am looking for is as follows:

public static void mergeCells(Cell targetCell, Cell sourceCell)
{
for(Node child : sourceCell.getChildNodes())
{
targetCell.append(child.clone());
}
}

Any ideas with aspose.words java


Regards!
